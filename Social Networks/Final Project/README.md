The aim of this  project is to develop a graph randomized construction and a local greedy routing algorithm ensuring navigability. In particular we started from "Navigable Graphs for High-Dimensional Nearest Neighbor Search: Constructions and Limits", that provides two graph generation procedure ensuring bound for the average degree of a navigable graph, generalizing Kleingberg's reachability to $\mathbb{R}^d$ equipped with any semi-metric. In particular, the proved upper bound for the average degree is $\sqrt{n \log n}$: given this benchmark, we wanted to explore some sparser constructions trying to tighten the upper bound to $\sqrt{n}$ employing a combination of $\textit{power-of-k choices}$ in the randomized step of the graph construction and a 2-hop greedy routing procedure.
